### Most obvious things that need to be done right now:
* Distinguish GET from POST requests (And even other methods) without using external modules / libs, and process data accordingly.
* Add database integration.
* Add session management (Including support for recovery links)
* Generate API docs.
* Add RIA support (That would be interesting, huh?).
