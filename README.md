# Amazonia
Amazonia is an open-source request-based WSGI-compliant web framework for Python. The whole project started at the brazilian facebook group "Python Brasil".

### Most obvious things that need to be done right now:
* Distinguish GET from POST requests (And even other methods) without using external modules / libs, and process data accordingly.
* Add database integration.
* Add a templating engine (Amazonia will have its own, so no Jinja2 and other examples).
* Add session management (Including support for recovery links)
* Generate API docs.
* Add RIA support.
